How do we secure against users simply changing their UID in local storage 

Use blowfish to encrypt the UID with a 64bit key
Store the original UID in local storage
Store the encrypted UID in local storage
Display the original version in HTML and allow users to share it for stats
Unorthodoxically (that's not a word ) the encrypted version shouldn't be shared
This is because decrypting/encrypting is a resourceful operation, if we shared the encrypted version then the server would constantly need to decrypt for stats. If the original is shared instead no encryption/decryption is necessary however when a user first connects, their key encrypted key can be pulled from local storage and a one time decryption can be performed to link the user to their data
